title: A simplified blog workflow with Next.js and Contentlayer

This site has gone through a few iterations, serving as a playground and opportunity for learning. Along the way I've tried [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/), before eventually settling on Next with [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/).

Each of the former required a lot of boilerplate for what was essentially just a task of loading some MDX files and displaying them nicely. Mind you, at the time of writing this, TinaCMS and Contentlayer are both pre-1.0.
